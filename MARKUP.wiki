= Minimal Markup =

This document specifies the
Minimal Markup language
used in the Welkin Standard.
Minimal Markup is an 
unambiguous subset of
MediaWiki Markup,
providing the best of both worlds:

* The subset helps
	to unify the presentation 
	of the Standard across platforms, 
	helping to make it precise as possible.

* MediaWiki is a well supported format,
  having well-formed and accessible HTML,
	as well as text editor support.

The text documents are
the final format, 
and can be
consulted for ambiguities
from HTML rendering.

A CFG may be given to
Minimal Markup,
but this is not provided here.
<!-- TODO: decide if a simple EBNF should be added for Minimal Markup -->

== Specification == 

* There are several elements:

** Headers start on a new line
	 are surrounded by a 
	 set of delimiters <code> = </code>.
	 Inside, there is a single space,
	 followed by a non space character,
	 followed by any number of characters,
	 and finally ending with a space.

** Paragraphs can contain UTF-8 and optional
	 formatting characters.

** Links are written with brackets.

* Each element is separated by a newline.
