= Minimal Markup =

This document specifies the
Minimal Markup language
used in the Welkin Standard.
Minimal Markup is an 
unambiguous subset of
MediaWiki Markup,
providing the best of both worlds:

* The subset helps
	to unify the presentation 
	of the Standard across platforms, 
	helping to make it precise as possible.
* MediaWiki is a well supported format,
  having well-formed and accessible HTML.

The text documents are
the final format, 
and can be
consulted for ambiguities
from HTML rendering.

A CFG may be given to
Minimal Markup,
but this is not provided here.
<!-- TODO: decide if a simple EBNF should be added for Minimal Markup -->
